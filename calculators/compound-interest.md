## 🧮 Manual Calculation Formula

### Future Value of Annuity (Regular Contributions)

```
FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

Where:
FV  = Future Value
PMT = Payment per period (annual contribution)
r   = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
n   = Number of periods (years)
```

**Example:**
- Annual contribution: $7,000
- Rate: 8% (0.08)
- Years: 30

```
FV = 7,000 × [(1.08)^30 - 1] / 0.08
FV = 7,000 × [10.0627 - 1] / 0.08
FV = 7,000 × 9.0627 / 0.08
FV = 7,000 × 113.28
FV = $792,960
```

## 📈 Power of Higher Returns

### Impact of 1% Difference Over 30 Years

**$7,000/year contribution:**

| Return | 30-Year Value | Difference from 7% |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 6% | $528,751 | -$135,637 |
| 7% | $664,388 | baseline |
| 8% | $792,960 | +$128,572 |
| 9% | $953,547 | +$289,159 |
| 10% | $1,149,072 | +$484,684 |

**Key insight:** 
- 6% vs 8% = $264K difference
- This is why low-fee index funds matter!
- A 1% higher fee = ~$130K less retirement money

## 💡 Impact of Fees

### Same Investment, Different Fees (30 years, $7K/year, 8% gross return)

| Fee | Net Return | Final Value | Cost vs 0.04% |
|-----|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 0.04% | 7.96% | $787,386 | $0 (baseline) |
| 0.25% | 7.75% | $754,012 | -$33,374 |
| 0.50% | 7.50% | $720,489 | -$66,897 |
| 1.00% | 7.00% | $664,388 | -$122,998 |
| 1.50% | 6.50% | $610,438 | -$176,948 |

**Fees of 1% cost you $123K over 30 years!**

This is why we recommend:
- Vanguard index funds: 0.03-0.04% fees
- Avoid actively managed funds: 1%+ fees

## 💸 Effect of Increasing Contributions

**Key insight:** Even small increases compound massively!

## 🎓 Rule of 72

**Quick way to calculate doubling time:**

```
Years to double = 72 / Interest Rate

Examples:
- 6% return: 72 / 6 = 12 years
- 7% return: 72 / 7 = 10.3 years
- 8% return: 72 / 8 = 9 years
- 10% return: 72 / 10 = 7.2 years
```

**What this means for you:**
- $100K at 8% becomes $200K in 9 years
- $200K becomes $400K in another 9 years
- $400K becomes $800K in another 9 years

**From age 25-52 (27 years = 3 doublings):**
- $100K → $200K → $400K → $800K
- Plus all your new contributions!
