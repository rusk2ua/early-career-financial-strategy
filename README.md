> A comprehensive guide for achieving financial independence and retiring between ages 55-60

## 📊 Your Profile

- **Income:** $80,000/year
- **Company Match:** 50% of first 6% (3% total match)
- **Monthly Expenses:** $4,000
- **Risk Tolerance:** High
- **Primary Goal:** Reach $250,000 as early as possible
- **Retirement Target:** Age 55-60

## 🎯 Quick Start: Top 5 Priorities

### 1️⃣ Maximize Company 401(k) Match + Go Beyond

**Immediate Action:**
- Contribute **at least 6%** to get full 3% match ($2,400 free money/year)
- Push to **15-20% total** contribution ($12,000-$16,000/year)

**Why it matters:**
- Instant 50% return on match - unbeatable
- $2,400 match grows to $86,400 over 30 years (at 7% growth)
- 15% contribution gets you to $250K in ~13 years

### 2️⃣ Max Out Roth IRA Every Year

**Immediate Action:**
- Contribute **$7,000/year** (2026 limit)
- Set up automatic monthly transfer: **$583/month**
- Invest in aggressive growth index funds

**Why it matters:**
- Tax-free growth for 30+ years
- Flexibility for early retirement (withdraw contributions penalty-free)
- $7K/year for 30 years = **$664,000 tax-free** (at 7% growth)
- Critical for early retirement access before age 59½

**⚠️ High Earners (Income >$150K):**
- Roth IRA phases out at $150K-$165K (single) or $236K-$246K (married)
- Use Backdoor Roth IRA strategy (still works!)
- If employer allows (like Amazon), consider **Mega Backdoor Roth** for up to $44K more/year
- See [Age-Based Priorities](./docs/age-based-priorities.md#important-income-limits--advanced-strategies) for details

### 3️⃣ Adopt the "Pay Yourself First" 30% Savings Rule

**Immediate Action:**
- Save/invest **30% of gross income = $24,000/year minimum**
  - 401(k): $12,000-$16,000 (15-20%)
  - Roth IRA: $7,000
  - Taxable brokerage: $1,000-$5,000

**Path to $250K:**
- $24K/year at 8% returns = **$250K in 8.5 years** (by age ~33)
- $24K/year at 10% returns = **$250K in 7.8 years** (by age ~32)

### 4️⃣ Build an Aggressive, Low-Cost Investment Portfolio

**Immediate Action:**
- Allocate: **90% stocks / 10% bonds** (until age 40)
- Focus on index funds:
  - 70% Total US Stock Market (VTI, VTSAX, or equivalent)
  - 20% International (VXUS, VTIAX, or equivalent)
  - 10% Bonds (BND, VBTLX for stability)

**Why it matters:**
- Index funds average 7-10% returns long-term
- Ultra-low fees (0.03-0.10%) vs. 1%+ for active funds
- $1 invested at 25 becomes **$7.61 by age 55** (at 7%)

### 5️⃣ Create Your "Early Retirement Bridge" Strategy

**Immediate Action:**
- Build **taxable brokerage** account for age 55-59½ gap
- Plan to use "Rule of 55" for penalty-free 401(k) access
- Set up Roth IRA ladder strategy
- Budget $800-$1,200/month for healthcare (ACA marketplace)

**Target numbers for age 55:**
- **$1.5-2 million total** investments
- Supports $60-80K/year withdrawal (4% rule)
- Healthcare bridge: ~$50K saved separately
- Emergency fund: 12 months expenses ($48K)
