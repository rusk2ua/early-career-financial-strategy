# Age-Based Priority Guide: Roth IRA vs 401(k)

> Understanding which retirement account to prioritize at different life stages

## 🔑 The Universal Rule (All Ages)

**ALWAYS get the full company match first!**

This is an instant 50% return (in your case) that nothing else can beat. This is your #1 priority regardless of age.

**For your situation:**
- Contribute 6% to 401(k) = $4,800/year
- Company adds 3% match = $2,400/year
- Total: $7,200/year going into 401(k)

## 📊 Priority by Age Group

### Ages 25-35: 🥇 ROTH IRA WINS

#### Priority Order:
1. ✅ **401(k) to company match** (6% = $4,800 + $2,400 match)
2. ✅ **MAX OUT Roth IRA** ($7,000/year)
3. ✅ **Then increase 401(k)** toward max ($23,000 limit)
4. ✅ **Taxable brokerage** if you still have room

#### Why Roth IRA First at This Age:

**1. Tax-Free Growth for 30+ Years**
- Your money compounds tax-free forever
- Math example: $7K/year in Roth from age 25-35 (just 10 years)
  - Total invested: $70,000
  - Value at age 60: **$470,000** tax-free (at 7% growth)
  - If in 401(k) taxed at 22%: $470K → $367K net
  - **You saved $103K in taxes!**

**2. Maximum Flexibility**
- Can withdraw contributions penalty-free anytime
- Perfect safety net for emergencies
- Critical for early retirement before age 59½
- No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) - ever!

**3. Tax Diversification**
- You're likely in a lower tax bracket now (22% at $80K)
- Pay taxes on $7K now rather than on $50K+ later in retirement
- Hedge against future tax increases
- Government could raise tax rates - lock in today's rate

**4. Income Eligibility**
- At $80K single, you're well within limits
- Phase-out starts at $146K single, $230K married
- Take advantage while you still can!

**5. Compound Interest Superpower**
- Starting at 25 vs 35 = ~$300K difference by age 60
- Every year matters exponentially
- Time is your greatest asset

#### The Math is Clear:

| Scenario | Roth IRA (25-35) | 401(k) Extra (25-35) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Annual contribution | $7,000 | $7,000 |
| Total invested | $70,000 | $70,000 |
| Value at 60 (7%) | $470,000 | $470,000 |
| **After tax** | **$470,000** | **$367,000** (22% tax) |
| **Tax savings** | **$103,000** | $0 |

### Ages 35-45: ⚖️ BALANCED APPROACH

#### Priority Order:
1. ✅ **401(k) to company match** (always #1)
2. ✅ **MAX OUT Roth IRA** ($7,000/year) - still prioritize
3. ✅ **Increase 401(k) substantially** (aim for $15-20K/year)
4. ✅ **Taxable brokerage** for surplus

#### Why It's Balanced:

**Still Prioritize Roth Because:**
- Another 15-20 years of tax-free growth is huge
- You're building your "early retirement access" fund
- Tax diversification becomes critical
- Flexibility for life changes (job loss, sabbatical, etc.)

**But 401(k) Becomes More Important Because:**
- You're in prime earning years (hopefully higher income)
- Pre-tax savings reduces current tax burden
- Larger contribution limits ($23K vs $7K)
- Need to accelerate wealth building with less time

#### Recommended Split:
- **$7,000** → Roth IRA (max it out)
- **$15,000-20,000** → 401(k) (total, including match)
- **$3,000-5,000** → Taxable brokerage (if possible)
- **Total: $25,000-32,000/year**

### Ages 45-55: 🥇 401(k) TAKES PRIORITY

#### Priority Order:
1. ✅ **401(k) to company match** (always)
2. ✅ **MAX OUT 401(k)** ($23,000/year, or $30,500 with catch-up at 50+)
3. ✅ **Then MAX Roth IRA** (still do it, but after 401k)
4. ✅ **Health Savings Account (HSA)** if available
5. ✅ **Taxable brokerage** for early retirement bridge

#### Why 401(k) First Now:

**1. Time is Running Out**
- You have only 10 years to hit your $1.5-2M retirement goal
- Need to maximize contributions to catch up
- Can't afford to leave money on the table

**2. Likely Higher Income = Higher Tax Bracket**
- Hopefully earning $100K+ by this age
- Pre-tax 401(k) saves you 24-32% in taxes NOW
- Bigger benefit from tax deferral

**3. "Rule of 55" Access**
- If you retire at 55 from current employer
- Can access 401(k) penalty-free (unlike IRA which requires 59½)
- Critical for early retirement strategy

**4. Catch-Up Contributions**
- At age 50+: Can add $7,500 MORE to 401(k)
- Total: $30,500/year to 401(k)
- Roth IRA: Only $8,000/year at 50+
- **401(k) allows 3.8x more savings**

**5. Roth Conversions Later**
- In early retirement (55-59), you'll have low/no income
- Convert 401(k) to Roth during these low-tax years
- Pay little to no tax on conversions
- Best of both worlds!

#### The Late-Career Math:

**Scenario: Age 45-55 (10 years)**

| Account | Annual | 10 Years Total | Age 55 Value (7%) |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 401(k) max | $23,000 | $230,000 | $331,000 |
| 401(k) catch-up (50+) | +$7,500 | +$37,500 | +$55,000 |
| Roth IRA | $7,000 | $70,000 | $101,000 |
| **Total** | **$37,500** | **$337,500** | **$487,000** |

Plus your existing savings from ages 25-45!

| 30 | $7,000 | 30 years | $665,000 |

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: "I'll max 401(k) first because bigger is better"
- Missing out on Roth's tax-free growth in your 20s
- Paying higher taxes later
- Less flexibility for early retirement

### ❌ Mistake 2: "I'll wait until I make more money"
- Missing years of compound growth
- Can't go back in time
- Perfect can be the enemy of good ($3K/year is better than $0!)

### ❌ Mistake 3: "Taxes will be lower in retirement"
- Uncertain tax policy (rates may increase)
- Your spending may not decrease as much as you think
- Social Security might be taxed
- Required Minimum Distributions can push you into higher bracket

### ❌ Mistake 4: "I prefer Traditional IRA to Roth"
- At $80K income, Roth IRA is almost always better
- You can't touch Traditional IRA until 59½ without penalty
- Roth gives you flexibility for early retirement

---

## ✅ The Bottom Line

**Age 20-35:** ROTH IRA > 401(k) (beyond match)
**Age 35-45:** ROTH IRA = 401(k) (max both if possible)
**Age 45-55:** 401(k) > ROTH IRA (but still do both!)

**At your current age (~25):**
### MAX THAT ROTH IRA EVERY YEAR!

Your 55-year-old self will thank you for having hundreds of thousands in tax-free money that you can access penalty-free for early retirement.
