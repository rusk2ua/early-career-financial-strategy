# Investment Strategy Guide

> Building a high-growth, low-cost portfolio for early retirement

## 🎯 Core Investment Philosophy

### The Three Pillars

1. **Low-Cost Index Funds** - Minimize fees, maximize returns
2. **Aggressive Allocation** - High stock exposure in your 20s-30s
3. **Buy and Hold** - Time in market > timing the market

---

## 📊 Asset Allocation by Age

### Ages 25-35: 90/10 Portfolio

**90% Stocks / 10% Bonds**

```
Stock Allocation (90%):
├── 70% US Total Market (VTI, VTSAX)
├── 20% International (VXUS, VTIAX)
└── 10% Bonds (BND, VBTLX)
```

**Why This Allocation:**
- Maximum growth potential
- High risk tolerance + long time horizon = aggressive is smart
- Stocks historically return 10% annually
- Bonds provide minimal stability
- Can weather market crashes (30+ years to recover)

### Ages 35-45: 80/20 Portfolio

**80% Stocks / 20% Bonds**

```
Stock Allocation (80%):
├── 60% US Total Market
├── 20% International
└── 20% Bonds
```

**Why Shift:**
- Slightly more conservative as retirement approaches
- Still aggressive but with cushion
- Bonds help reduce volatility

### Ages 45-55: 70/30 Portfolio

**70% Stocks / 30% Bonds**

```
Stock Allocation (70%):
├── 50% US Total Market
├── 20% International
└── 30% Bonds
```

**Why Shift:**
- Protect accumulated wealth
- Less time to recover from crashes
- Still growth-focused but safer

### Age 55+ (Early Retirement): 60/40 Portfolio

**60% Stocks / 40% Bonds**

```
Stock Allocation (60%):
├── 40% US Total Market
├── 20% International
└── 40% Bonds
```

**Why Final Shift:**
- Capital preservation becomes priority
- Living off portfolio - can't risk major losses
- Bonds provide stable income
- Still growth for 30+ years of retirement

## 📈 Expected Returns by Allocation

| Portfolio | Avg Return | Bad Year | Good Year | 30-Year Growth ($1) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 100% Stocks | 10% | -40% | +30% | $17.45 |
| 90/10 | 9.5% | -36% | +27% | $15.22 |
| 80/20 | 9% | -32% | +24% | $13.27 |
| 70/30 | 8.5% | -28% | +21% | $11.56 |
| 60/40 | 8% | -24% | +18% | $10.06 |

**Key Insight:** The difference between 10% and 8% over 30 years is MASSIVE:
- $7K/year at 10% = $1.23 million
- $7K/year at 8% = $850K
- **Difference: $380K!**

This is why aggressive allocation in your 20s-30s is crucial.

## 🔄 Rebalancing Strategy

### When to Rebalance

**Annual Rebalancing (Recommended):**
- Pick a date (e.g., January 1, your birthday)
- Check if any asset is off by more than 5%
- Sell high performers, buy low performers
- Use new contributions to bring back to target

**Example:**
```
Target: 70% VTI, 20% VXUS, 10% BND
Current: 75% VTI, 18% VXUS, 7% BND

Action: Sell 5% of VTI, buy 2% VXUS and 3% BND
Or: Invest new money entirely in VXUS and BND
```

### Tax Considerations

**In Roth IRA or 401(k):**
- Rebalance freely - no tax consequences
- Sell winners, buy losers without worry

**In Taxable Brokerage:**
- Be careful - selling triggers capital gains tax
- Use new contributions to rebalance
- Only sell if absolutely necessary
- Tax-loss harvest to offset gains

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Pick Individual Stocks
- 80% of professionals can't beat the index
- You won't either (nobody can consistently)
- Massive risk for minimal potential reward
- Index funds win long-term

### ❌ Don't Time the Market
- Nobody can predict crashes
- Missing the 10 best days costs you 50% of returns
- Stay invested through ups and downs
- "Time in market > timing the market"

### ❌ Don't Pay High Fees
- 1% fee vs 0.04% fee = $590K difference over 40 years!
- Actively managed funds rarely beat index
- Avoid funds with expense ratios >0.20%
- Every 0.1% in fees costs you ~$100K in retirement

### ❌ Don't Panic Sell in Bear Markets
- Market crashes are BUYING opportunities
- Stocks are on sale
- 2008 crash: -57%... then +400% recovery
- 2020 COVID crash: -34%... then +120% recovery
- Those who stayed in won big

### ❌ Don't Over-Diversify
- Owning 50 different funds isn't better
- Three-fund portfolio is plenty
- More complexity ≠ better returns
- Keep it simple!

### ❌ Don't Chase Performance
- Last year's winner is often next year's loser
- Crypto, meme stocks, "hot tips" = gambling
- Stick to boring index funds
- Boring = wealthy

## 💡 Advanced Strategies

### Tax-Loss Harvesting (Taxable Accounts Only)

**What it is:**
- Sell losing investments to offset capital gains
- Immediately buy similar (but not identical) fund
- Reduce tax bill while staying invested

**Example:**
- VTI is down 10% = $5,000 loss
- Sell VTI, immediately buy SCHB (similar fund)
- Use $5,000 loss to offset other gains
- Saves $1,000+ in taxes (at 20% capital gains rate)

### Roth IRA Conversion Ladder (For Early Retirement)

**What it is:**
- Convert Traditional 401(k) to Roth IRA
- Pay taxes on conversion in low-income years
- After 5 years, withdraw conversions penalty-free

**When to use:**
- Ages 55-59 before you can access IRA
- You have little/no income (already retired)
- Pay minimal taxes on conversions
- Access money without penalty

### Mega Backdoor Roth (Advanced Strategy for High Earners)

**What it is:**
The Mega Backdoor Roth is a powerful strategy that allows you to contribute significantly more to Roth accounts beyond the standard $7,000 Roth IRA limit. This is especially valuable for:
- High earners who exceed Roth IRA income limits
- Those who want to maximize tax-free retirement savings
- Anyone with an employer that supports this feature

**How it works:**
1. Max out regular 401(k) contributions ($23,500 in 2026)
2. Make additional **after-tax** (not Roth, not pre-tax) contributions to 401(k)
3. Immediately convert those after-tax contributions to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA
4. Result: Tax-free growth forever, just like a Roth IRA

**The Math:**
```
2026 Total 401(k) Limit:              $70,000
Your contribution (pre-tax):          -$23,500
Employer match (3% on $80K):          -$2,400
Remaining for after-tax:              $44,100

Potential Mega Backdoor Roth:         $44,100/year!
```

**Requirements (ALL must be met):**
1. ✅ Employer 401(k) plan allows **after-tax contributions** (not just Roth 401(k))
2. ✅ Employer plan allows **in-service conversions** (convert while still employed)
3. ✅ You've already maxed regular 401(k) ($23,500)
4. ✅ You have extra cash flow to contribute beyond the $23,500

**Known Employers Supporting Mega Backdoor Roth:**
- ✅ **Amazon** - Full support for Mega Backdoor Roth
- ✅ Many large tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple)
- ✅ Some financial services firms
- ❌ Most small/medium businesses do NOT support this

**How to Check if Your Employer Offers This:**
1. Contact HR or 401(k) plan administrator
2. Ask: "Does our 401(k) plan allow after-tax contributions?"
3. Ask: "Does our plan allow in-service conversions or withdrawals?"
4. If both are YES, you can do Mega Backdoor Roth!

**Tax Implications:**
- After-tax contributions: NOT tax deductible (you pay tax now)
- Conversions to Roth: No additional tax if converted immediately
- Future growth: 100% tax-free (just like Roth IRA)
- Withdrawals in retirement: 100% tax-free

**Comparison to Regular Roth:**

| Strategy | Annual Limit | Tax Benefit | Income Limits |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Roth IRA | $7,000 | Tax-free growth | Yes ($150K-$165K phase-out) |
| Roth 401(k) | $23,500 | Tax-free growth | No income limits |
| **Mega Backdoor Roth** | **Up to $44,100** | **Tax-free growth** | **No income limits** |

**Example Timeline:**
```
January 2026:
- Set 401(k) to $1,958/month ($23,500/year)
- Set after-tax 401(k) to $3,675/month ($44,100/year)
- Enable automatic in-service conversion to Roth

Every paycheck:
- $1,958 goes to pre-tax 401(k)
- $3,675 goes to after-tax 401(k)
- After-tax amount automatically converts to Roth 401(k)

End of year:
- Pre-tax 401(k): $23,500 (compounds tax-deferred)
- Roth 401(k): $44,100 (compounds tax-free!)
- Total: $67,600 in retirement accounts!
```

**30-Year Impact:**
```
Mega Backdoor Roth ($44,100/year for 30 years at 8%):
- Total contributed: $1,323,000
- Value at retirement: $5,439,000
- All tax-free withdrawals: Save ~$1,087,800 in taxes!

Regular investing ($44,100/year in taxable account):
- Value at retirement: $5,439,000
- Taxes on gains (20%): -$1,087,800
- Net: $4,351,200

Mega Backdoor advantage: $1,087,800!
```

**When to Use Mega Backdoor Roth:**

✅ **DO use if:**
- You max out regular 401(k) and Roth IRA
- Your employer supports it (like Amazon)
- You have cash flow to contribute more
- You're a high earner (over Roth IRA limits)

❌ **DON'T use if:**
- You haven't maxed regular 401(k) yet (do that first!)
- You haven't maxed Roth IRA yet (do that first!)
- Your employer doesn't support it
- You need the cash flow for other goals

**Important Notes:**
- This is NOT the same as a "Backdoor Roth IRA" (different strategy)
- Requires discipline to convert immediately (avoid tax on growth)
- Some plans only allow annual conversions (less ideal than immediate)
- If you leave your job, you can roll Roth 401(k) to Roth IRA

**Action Steps if Your Employer Offers This:**
1. Max out regular 401(k) first ($23,500)
2. Max out Roth IRA first ($7,000)
3. Contact 401(k) administrator to set up after-tax contributions
4. Set up automatic in-service conversions to Roth
5. Contribute as much extra as you can afford
6. Watch your tax-free retirement account grow exponentially!

**For Amazon Employees:**
Amazon's 401(k) plan (through Fidelity) fully supports Mega Backdoor Roth with automatic in-service conversions. If you work at Amazon and earn $120K+, this strategy can help you save an additional $40K+/year tax-free!
